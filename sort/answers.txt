sort1 uses: bubble

How do you know?:
Because it is a largely inefficient sorting method, taking >5s to sort 50,000 numbers, however when
it is fed a already sorted list, it is almost instant sorting.
Bubble sort would only need to loop through the list once to determine it was given a pre-sorted list.


sort2 uses: merge

How do you know?:
It is a very fast and efficient sorting method. It takes a consistent time, regardless of what list it is given.
Merge sort uses a very efficient way of comparing, but it still needs to do all the comparisons regardless of if it is given a pre-sorted list


sort3 uses: selection

How do you know?:
because the time it takes to complete is roughly the same, regardless of which list it is told to sort.
It also appears inefficient compared to sort2. Implies it uses linear and consistent algorithm
